Functional Programming:

Focuses on functions, or mathematical functions.
Code is organized into functions, and programs are a collection of functions.
Functions are immutable, meaning they always give the same output for the same input.
No mutable state or variable assignment.
Procedural Programming:

Focuses on procedures, or steps to complete a task.
Code is organized via procedures that call other procedures.
Data is passed between procedures.
Uses assignments and variables that can be mutated and reassigned.
Object-Oriented Programming:

Focuses on objects that contain both data and functions.
Objects represent real-world entities.
Objects communicate by passing and receiving messages.
Emphasizes data abstraction and encapsulation.
Uses classes as blueprints for creating objects.
